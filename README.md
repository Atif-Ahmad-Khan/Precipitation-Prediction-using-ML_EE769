Precipitation prediction is a crucial aspect of weather forecasting. This project focuses on developing a machine-learning model to predict precipitation levels based on various meteorological parameters. The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, balancing classes, encoding categorical features, and feature selection before training multiple machine learning models.
Precipitation prediction is primarily used for effective water resource management, disaster preparedness, agricultural planning, and transportation safety by providing timely information about potential rain events, allowing individuals and organizations to make informed decisions to mitigate risks associated with floods, droughts, and extreme weather conditions; essentially, accurate rainfall forecasts help minimize damage and loss of life by enabling proactive measures like evacuations or adjusting agricultural practices based on anticipated precipitation levels.
